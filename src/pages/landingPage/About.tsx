            Over the last decade, our portfolio of visualization tools has emerged through the close collaboration between the Growth Lab’s Digital Development &amp; Design team and our research teams.  Our flagship tool, the <a href='https://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/'>Atlas of Economic Complexity</a>, exemplifies this collaboration by beautifully showcasing research, datasets, and pedagogy developed across multidisciplinary teams and countless iterations.  Since its launch in 2013, the Atlas has been complimented by sub-national Atlases, country dashboards, interactive stories, open source software packages, and working prototypes.
