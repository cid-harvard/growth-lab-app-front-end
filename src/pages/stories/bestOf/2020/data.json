Although Jordan has taken substantial efforts to diversify its sources of fuel and expand low-cost renewable electricity generation, the transition has had a permanent effect on the average cost of electricity and led to high levels of cross-subsidization in order to keep the price of electricity low for most households.  The price dispersion tripled in the process.",

Much of Ethiopia’s spectacular import growth since 2004 was initially funded by aid and exports. However, Ethiopia became increasingly reliant on external borrowing over time and lost access after 2015, forcing imports to stagnate and growth to slow.",
