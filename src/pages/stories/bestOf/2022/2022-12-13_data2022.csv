This figure shows Africa’s population at 20-kilometer aggregation and the area covered by 16-hour travel times to Walvis Bay and peer ports in south-, mid-western, and eastern Africa. The area covered by 16 hours of travel to the port of Walvis Bay reaches a limited market, even though it is relatively more extensive than most of its peer ports. In comparison, most of the population in Botswana, Zimbabwe, and Zambia have shorter routse to travel to the ports of Beira or Durban. This suggests that Namibia might need strategies to improve the inland reach and competitiveness of the port (railway connectivity, lower border delays, and improved turnaround times at the port).",AfriLearn R package,https://growthlab.cid.harvard.edu/policy-research/namibia,,port_cities_southern_africa_travel_time_distance.png
