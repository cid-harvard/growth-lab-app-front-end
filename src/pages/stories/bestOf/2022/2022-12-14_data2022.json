      "description": "From 2012 onwards, the Walvis Bay port in Namibia suffered a collapse in containerized cargo, driven by plummeting transshipment volumes and a massive contraction in Angola’s imports. This figure shows Africa’s population at 20-kilometer aggregation and the area covered by 16-hour travel times to Walvis Bay and peer ports in south-, mid-western, and eastern Africa. The area covered by 16 hours of travel to the port of Walvis Bay reaches a limited market, even though it is relatively more extensive than most of its peer ports. In comparison, most of the population in Botswana, Zimbabwe, and Zambia have shorter routse to travel to the ports of Beira or Durban. This suggests that Namibia might need strategies to improve the inland reach and competitiveness of the port (railway connectivity, lower border delays, and improved turnaround times at the port).",

An important part of these sanctions are restrictions on exports to Russia. Growth Lab research shows that, in general, export restrictions are an effective policy instrument that achieves the objective of cutting Russia off from critical supplies for its economy. But current sanctions do not leverage their full potential and suffer from serious coordination problems among the anti-Putin coalition, enabling Russia to substitute between coalition suppliers. We show how the efficacy of these sanctions can be raised by ~60% through better coordination and concentrating sanctions on products with the highest impact on Russia.",

      "description": "Export diversification is key for development. Because industries differ significantly in their occupational inputs and because, in many countries, the current workforce performs only a subset of occupations, export diversification typically requires training people in new occupations. Such training is costly, and hence it is easier for a country to enter industries that rely more on occupations in which the domestic population already expresses capabilites. New Growth Lab research shows that a country’s export specialization can have long-lasting consequences for its ability to diversify its economy and provides potentially large scope for industrial policy to support entry into new industries.",

      "description": "The pandemic made salient that jobs differ in many ways, including the ability to perform the job from home. This figure shows the proportion of jobs in an industry that can be performed remotely and the median wage of jobs in that industry (where the size of bubbles reflects the U.S. industry size). Lower-wage industries, such as restaurants and retail, have a low proportion of jobs that can be done from home. Conversely, many high-income industries, such as legal services and software development, are more readily performed from home.",

      "description": "Deforestation in the Colombian Amazon differs significantly across space based on the legal status of land, concentrating in areas with unclear legal status. The majority of forest land in Caquetá, Guaviare, and Putumayo lies within a national park or indigenous reserve, which contributes little to deforestation. Most of the deforestation (83%) occurs in other land regimes, which only control 39% of the total Amazon rainforest. This suggests that deforestation can be tackled by addressing patterns of property regime control in the Amazon rainforest.",
