Because industries differ largely in their occupational inputs and because in many countries the domestic population performs only a subset of occupations, export diversification typically requires training people in new occupations. Such training is costly and, hence, it is easier for a country to enter industries that rely more on occupations that the domestic population is already capable of performing. New Growth Lab research shows that this is indeed the case. It implies that a country’s export specialization can have long lasting consequences for its ability to diversify its economy, and provides potentially large scope for industrial policy to support entry into new industries.",Atlas trade data; BLS OES,https://growthlab.cid.harvard.edu/publications/simple-theory-economic-development-extensive-industry-margin,,P2PE_322_vizhub2022.png

The survey revealed, among other things, that firms tend to exclusively utilize either the official market for foreign exchange or the black market, though some use a mix of both. Large firms are more likely to access foreign exchange through the official market (at a more desirable exchange rate), while other firms are more likely to turn to the black market (and a less favorable exchange rate) because they cannot access foreign exchange through official channels.",Growth Lab / Ethiopian Economics Association Importer Survey,https://growthlab.cid.harvard.edu/policy-research/ethiopia,Ethiopia Importer Survey (may be online soon),official_vs_black_market_exchange_rate_ethiopian_importers.png

This network could be thought of as the inverse of the Product Space, which shows the links between products with respect to their co-location in countries. We constructed the network by considering only manufacturing HS products at the 4-digit level. The relatedness was estimated by calculating the cosine similarity of the matrix of countries and their manufacturing exports and selecting the two most similar partners to each country (Hausmann et al., 2021).  The size or weight of the edges correspond to their similarity value. The countries are colored by regions. The network shows that South Africa is in a cluster of countries for which manufacturing is heavily oriented towards metals and products related to the mining and energy industries, consistent with the literature on the structure of South African manufacturing. Furthermore, these countries’ economic complexity has been decreasing over time, which suggests that they are facing similar bottlenecks in terms of diversification of productive capabilities.",,,,manufacturing_country_space.png

What is the potential for the port to attract cargo from landlocked countries? This figure shows Africa’s population at 20-kilometer aggregation and the area covered by 16-hour travel times to Walvis Bay and peer ports in south-, mid-western and eastern Africa. The area covered by 16 hours of travel to the port of Walvis Bay reaches a limited market, even though it is relatively more extensive than most of its peer ports. For example, most of the population in Botswana, Zimbabwe, and Zambia find a better route to travel to the ports of Beira or Durban.
