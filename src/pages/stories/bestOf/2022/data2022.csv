An important part of these sanctions are restrictions on exports to Russia. Growth Lab research shows that export restrictions are in general an effective policy instrument that allows cutting Russia off critical supplies for its economy. But current sanctions do not leverage the full potential of these sanctions, and they suffer from serious coordination problems among the anti-Putin coalition, enabling Russia to substitute between coalition suppliers. We show how the efficacy of these sanctions can be raised by ~60% through better coordination and concentrating sanctions on products with highest impact on Russia",https://www.globaltradealert.org/,https://growthlab.cid.harvard.edu/publications/design-effective-sanctions-case-bans-exports-russia,,PieSanctions_np.jpg

The majority of forest land in Caquetá, Guaviare and Putumayo lies within a national park or indigenous reserve, which contribute little to deforestation. Most of the deforestation (83%) occurs in other land regimes which only has 39% of forest. Therefore, deforestation can be tackled by addressing the property regime.","Author's elaboration based on IDEAM, WDPA and SIAC",,,forest_and_deforestration_under_different_property_regimes.png

The survey revealed, among other things, that firms tend to exclusively utilize either the official market for foreign exchange or the black market, though some use a mix of both. Large firms are more likely to access foreign exchange through the official market (at a more desirable exchange rate), while other firms are more likely to turn to the black market (and a less favorable exchange rate) because they cannot access foreign exchange through official channels.",Growth Lab / Ethiopian Economics Association Importer Survey,,Ethiopia Importer Survey (may be online soon),FX_sources.png

Most of the subsistence household agriculture happens in the north, but food production is not enough to cover the needs of the population, resulting in significant food shortages. In parallel, employment levels are exceptionally low, so households do not have sources of income that could help the north afford food imports. Additionally, the adverse natural conditions of the area have been worsened by climate change, resulting in significant losses of crop and animal production in recent years.","Namibia Labor Force Survey (2018), Namibia Household Income and Expenditure Survey (2015-2016)",https://growthlab.cid.harvard.edu/policy-research/namibia,,nam_agri_income_food.png

What is the potential for the port to attract cargo from landlocked countries? This figure shows Africa’s population at 20-kilometer aggregation and the area covered by 16-hour travel times to Walvis Bay and peer ports in south-, mid-western and eastern Africa. The area covered by 16 hours of travel to the port of Walvis Bay reaches a limited market, even though it is relatively more extensive than most of its peer ports. For example, most of the population in Botswana, Zimbabwe, and Zambia find a better route to travel to the ports of Beira or Durban.

Because industries differ largely in their occupational inputs and because in many countries the domestic population performs only a subset of occupations, export diversification typically requires training people in new occupations. Such training is costly and, hence, it is easier for a country to enter industries that rely more on occupations that the domestic population is already capable of performing. New Growth Lab research shows that this is indeed the case. It implies that a country’s export specialization can have long lasting consequences for its ability to diversify its economy, and provides potentially large scope for industrial policy to support entry into new industries.",Atlas trade data; BLS OES,https://growthlab.cid.harvard.edu/publications/simple-theory-economic-development-extensive-industry-margin,,P2PE_322_vizhub2022.png
